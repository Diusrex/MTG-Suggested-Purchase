MTG-Suggested-Purchase
======================

This program is designed for people who do not live in the U.S. but want to buy Magic the Gathering cards from tcgplayer.com.

This program will determine the store(s) with the highest percent of cards wanted, and then sort them by price (not including shipping).

Unfortunately, I have been unable to change the default country so it is necessary to save the webpage for each card wanted.
I intend on making this possible later in the summer, so if you have any suggestions feel free to comment.

Instructions
======================

Adding a new card:
	To add a new card there are two things you will need to do:
		1. Copy the name of the card to the Cards.txt file, followed by the number of that card that is wanted.
		1a. If this card is vital to a desired deck, follow the cards number with a 1. This identifies this card as being of high priority.
		2. On the website, ensure that the correct country is selected. (Country can be found on the lower left side of the screen)
		3. Save the webpage with the list of stores that carry the current card in the format "card name.htm"
		3a. If you want to save more than one page (this is suggested) then save subsequent pages as "card name page_number.htm" where page_number is how many times you have saved a page list for this card plus one
		


Running the program
======================

	This program should be able to run in Eclipse (I used version Kepler). 
	All you will need to do is import the project, then run the file ProgramStart
